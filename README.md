Overview

In this project we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

Data Sources

We worked with the data provided on the Starter Files: contacts.xlsx and crowfunding.xlsx
