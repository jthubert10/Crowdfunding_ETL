## Overview
In this project we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. Once the data was transformed, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. The final CSV file data was uploaded into a Postgres database. These are the tasks completed for this project:

    Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
    Create the Campaign DataFrame
    Create the Contacts DataFrame
    Create the Crowdfunding Database

## Data Sources
We worked with the data provided on the Starter Files: contacts.xlsx and crowfunding.xlsx

## Software
Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4

## Findings
Our final production database is relational. 

Once we built the database with SQL further analysis can be performed and reports can be created for company stakeholders.

## Summary
We have learned that ETL process facilitates performance in data analysis on database with ease and in less time making it more efficient.
