Overview:

In this project we use Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to perform an advanced analysis for Independent Funding. The company has received a new dataset that contains information about the backers who pledged to the live projects. Independent Funding wants us to perform an ETL process and a data analysis by using SQL queries. In this project it's necessary to first extract the data, then transform it and then load it in a SQL database. Important steps are to create an ERD and table schema for creating a new table in the database. At the end we perform a data analysis using SQL queries.

Deliverables:
1.	Category DataFrame is Created (15 pts)
2.	Subcategory Data Frame is Created (15 pts)
3.	Campaign DataFrame is Created (30 pts) (Note: This work cannot be started until Category & Subcat DFs are available.)
4.	Contacts DataFrame is Created (15 pts) (Note: Can be worked on without other code needed.)
5.	Crowdfunding DB (25 pts) (Note: Can be worked on without other files needed/but will need to reference headers, etc. from final products--but those are spelled out       in assignment description.)
6.	Merge all codes into one notebook, clean, concise comments, no errors, extra codes we do not need removed, etc., Professional Readme file created that meets all         required rubric elements, and then upload to github (0 pts)
